Summary:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains the implementation of flow computation required for
long-distance dispersal of the pest. We use the gravity model to generate
the flows. The inputs to the gravity model are the total inflow and total
outflow for each city and time taken between the cities. The inflows and
outflows are computed per month. The final out for one set of parameters is
12 directed, edge weighted network of flows.

This is validated using a variety of datasets.

An example is in ./scripts/master_create_networks.sh
