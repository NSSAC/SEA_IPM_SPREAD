Dear Editor,

Please find attached for your review the manuscript titled "Assessing the
Multi-pathway Threat from an Invasive Agricultural Pest: Tuta absoluta in
Asia", to be considered for possible publication in Proceedings of the
Royal Society B".

In this manuscript, we develop a data-driven agent-based model to study invasive
species spread capturing self-mediated as well as human-mediated pathways
of spread. It is applied to study the risk of spread of T. absoluta in
South and Southeast Asia, a region at the frontier of its current range.
This pest of tomato has gained a lot of attention in the last decade since
its introduction from South America to Spain in 2006. There have been
unofficial reports in Myanmar and very recently in Vietnam, and hence, this
is a timely analysis. Also, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work on T. absoluta which accounts for vegetable production and trade as a
pathway of spread.

This work has not been published in any journal, nor is it currently under
review elsewhere. All authors have seen and approved the manuscript and
have significantly contributed toward the paper. We appreciate your time
and consideration.

Thank you,
