It is possible that there
is lot of variation in consumption within a country as well as across
seasons. The relationship between trade volume and distance between
localities could vary from one region to another. Extending to other
regions such as North America, China or Australia, might require accounting
for seedling trade and greenhouse production.
One way to increase our understanding
is to analyze regions in Europe and Africa where \tuta{} has been present
for more than a decade to better calibrate our models. However, one needs
to be cautious while applying studies of one region to another. For
example, in Europe and parts of Africa seedling trade and greenhouse
cultivation play an important part in tomato production~\cite{}. 
%% Nopsa~et~al.~\cite{nopsa2015ecological} considered this problem in the
%% context of soybean rust in the US, modeling the spread as a propagation
%% process over a network of counties. They developed efficient strategies to
%% reduce the spread by identifying and monitoring only a subset of locations
%% which are critical for the spread.
%% Nevertheless, we considered the scenario in which \tuta{}
%% establishes in the region between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. The
%% simulations suggest that the pest will spread to most localities in
%% Malaysia and Sumatra, Indonesia within an year.
%% 
%% Our
%% results show that for all countries, once the pest is introduced, within
%% 2-3 years the it will spread to almost all localities, and when it reaches
%% a high production locality, it spreads to other regions within a year.
%% Past invasion records support this trend.
%% The pest became widespread in
%% countries Mediterranean
%% region, in Middleeastern countries, and in India in just 2-3 years.

%%   

%% We
%% considered two hypothetical scenarios: (i)~\tuta{} is introduced to the
%% Palawan region from Malaysian Borneo (natural pathway) and (ii)~it is introduced to the high
%% production area of Northern Mindanao. While in the first case we did not
%% observe spread beyond the Palawan region, in the second case, within two
%% years, almost all localities were invaded. The latter case is shown in
%% Figure~\ref{fig:phlBContour}.
%% However, we recall that trade between some countries was ignored, and as a
%% result our model might have missed some long-distance jumps.  For example,
%% from Vietnam, there is a possibility that it can enter Phnom Penh, Cambodia
%% through tomato imports during the rainy months~\cite{sokhen2004}. The
%% southwards spread to Malaysia might be faster than predicted by Class~B
%% spread due to exports from Thailand to Malaysia and Singapore.
%%
%% Class~A predicts that the entire Mainland Southeast Asia will be infested
%% with four years.
%% %% We considered three scenarios of introduction of the pest to the region.
%% %% The first scenario corresponds to evolution of the spread from Bangladesh
%% %% (B1). The other two are hypothetical scenarios based on the analysis in
%% %% Section~\ref{sec:entry}. Scenario~M corresponds to \tuta{} introduced near
%% %% a major port region of Malaysia. The third Scenario~P is its introduction
%% %% to Philippines close to the captial city Manila assuming introduction
%% %% due to migratory workers from \tuta{} affected regions.
%% 
%% From Figure~\ref{fig:totalSpread}, we observe that the range expansion is
%% much faster with Class~A compared to Class~B. The main reason for the slow
%% spread is due to not accounting for trade interactions between countries in
%% the model. The spread is characterized by slow spread between countries and
%% rapid expansion within. For example, the big jumps in range expansion
%% between time steps 72 and 120 is mainly due to spread within Myanmar
%% through long-distance jumps. The challenges in modeling international trade
%% are covered in Methods (Trade flows). But when we consider the global
%% spread pattern of \tuta{}, we observe reduction in rate of range expansion
%% in certain regions.
%% 
%% Also, the predicted spread could be
%% slower due boundary effects; we have not accounted for cells belonging to
%% Northeastern parts of India that share border with Bangladesh and Myanmar
%% and the Yunnan province of China.  On the other hand, when we focus on each
%% country separately (Figure~\ref{fig:spreadWithin}, we observe that the
%% spread within a country is much faster in the case of Class~B.  Results
%% suggest that major production areas of a country will be invaded within 2-3
%% years of introduction.
%% 
%% The spatio-temporal spread for Scenario~B1 is shown in
%% Figure~\ref{fig:spreadBGD}. The start time corresponds to~24 time steps (or
%% two years) from the first report. The results indicate that there is a high
%% chance that \tuta{} will spread to Mainland Southeast Asia in four to six
%% years. Because of long distance dispersal, we also observe a non-radial
%% spread. Aided by domestic trade and exports from Thailand, there is
%% possibility that the pest will be introduced to Peninsular Malaysia and
%% subsequently to Singapore and Indonesia in this period even though this
%% area is much farther from the current range of \tuta{}. Also, we see the
%% possibility of the pest crossing the sea from Peninsular Malaysia to
%% Malaysian Borneo within a year of introduction to this country. However,
%% these are conservative estimates. First of all, the simulations do not
%% account for possible new introductions. 

%% The spread due to other two scenarios are shown in Figures~\ref{spreadMYS}
%% and~\ref{spreadPHL} respectively. Note that in both of these scenarios we do not
%% account for the spread from Bangladesh. This is crucially dependent on the
%% time of introduction. However, it is critical to consider the synergistic
%% effects of range expansion from multiple locations. The spread in
%% Scenario~M follows a similar pattern as in Scenario~B3.

%% Specific observations
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item identify important vegetable production areas
%% \end{itemize}

%%
%% Among the countries listed in the FAOSTAT dataset, Indonesia is by far the
%% largest producer ($\approx1$M tonnes) followed by Philippines and Malaysia
%% ($\approx200$K tonnes each). However, alternate data sources (pers.
%% comm.) indicate that Vietnam is a large producer ($\approx400$K)
%% too.
%%
%% \paragraph{Predicted spread in Mainland Southeast Asia.}
%% We applied both model classes to simulate the spread in the rest of the
%% study region. Given that more than two years have passed since the time of
%% first report in Bangladesh and unofficial reports of \tuta{} presence in
%% Myanmar\footnote{The Wikipedia entry on \tuta{}
%%     (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuta_absoluta}) indicates
%% that it is present in the northern region of Myanmar since
%% April~2017. No official confirmation is available yet.}, cells in northern Myanmar bordering India and Bangladesh were
%% seeded (Methods). Representative simulation outputs are shown for Mainland
%% Southeast Asia in Figure~\ref{fig:msaClassAB}. We note that in the case of
%% Class~A models, the eastward spread is faster than southward spread. This
%% is mainly because the Moore neighborhood is smaller at the narrow region in
%% the south of Myanmar and Thailand bordering Malaysia. However, in
%% the case of Class~B, the spread is much faster in the same region aided by domestic
%% trade flows from northern and central Thailand to the southern region. Both models indicate that the pest will enter
%% Thailand from Myanmar, and subsequently move to Laos and Vietnam as it
%% spreads eastwards and to China when it spreads northwards.
%% %%
%% %Changed B to A
%%

%% To account for possible increase in production and trade, we boosted the
%% pathway parameters by (i)~25\% and (ii)~50\%. The results in
%% Figure~\ref{fig:spreadRate} show the increase in intensity of infection,
%% but not an appreciable increase in range.

%% Also, since horticultural products are less

%% For a cell in a locality (say~$L$), its neighbors are all cells that belong
%% to the locality.  
%% The objective is to cell's state is influenced by the infected cells in

%% \paragraph{State transitions.} The rules for state transitions are shown in
%% Figure~\ref{fig:SEI}. A susceptible ($S$) cell can be influenced by
%% infectious (state~$I$) cells through the three different pathways. Each
%% such cell infects the susceptible cell with some probability. If \tuta{} is
%% succesfully introduced to a cell, it moves from state~$S$ to~$E$. The
%% exposed state corresponds to the situation where \tuta{} has established,
%% but it is not widespread in the area to influence other cells. It stays in
%% state~$E$ for one time step before transitioning to state~$I$. This is a
%% reasonable assumption considering that the conditions are favorable for the
%% pest to complete a life cycle within one month.

%%     \caption{Schematic of the SEI process.\label{fig:SEI}}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% 
%% \paragraph{Susceptibility and infectiousness of a cell.} We have used
%% monthly production to determine the susceptiblity of a cell in state~$S$
%% and infectiousness of a cell in state~$I$. The suitability of a cell~$v$
%% for pest establishment at time~$t$ is denoted by~$\suitable(v,t)$. This
%% is~$1$ if production at~$t$ is non-zero and~$0$ otherwise.  For a cell in
%% state~$I$, the level of infestation in an infected cell~$v$ at time~$t$ is
%% denoted by~$\infest(v,t)$. It is modeled as a linear function of host
%% presence at time~$t$, for which we use the weighted sum of production
%% volume of tomato, eggplant, and potato in that cell
%% at time~$t$. The weights correspond to relative oviposition preference of
%% \tuta{} on the three hosts.
%% 
%%


%% For each region, we obtained the product rate by
%% normalizing quarterly production values with respect to maximum value among
%% these. We used production rate instead of production values since there are
%% several factors that determine a region's production: climate, vegetable
%% preference, demand, etc.  Therefore, it may not be meaningful to compare
%% production across regions.  
%% We conducted a linear regression with the
%% product rate as a dependent variable and precipitation and temperature and
%% elevation as independent variables.  To control elevation, we classified
%% the elevations into two groups, high and low, using $k$-means clustering
%% (SPSS~24.0). Due to the small sample size, we excluded the samples in the
%% high-elevation group and conducted a linear regression analysis for the
%% group of low elevation~($< 235$ masl). 

%% There is very little data
%% available for validation. Most of the data is qualitative, just providing
%% information on growing and harvesting months. The regression function was
%% applied to locations of different countries where this information is
%% available and visually compared.  More details of the methods, country
%% specific data and challenges in this regard are covered in
%% Section~\ref{S:sec:prod}. The infectiousness of cell~$v$ at
%% time~$t$,~$\infest(v,t)$ is the production at~$t$, while its
%% suitability,~$\epsilon(v,t)$ is~$0$ if~$\infest(v,t)=0$ and~$1$ otherwise.
%% on data availability. The first method was used if only seasonal
%% production is available for a region or country. In this case, we first
%% estimated seasonal production in each cell and then disaggregated it
%% to obtain monthly production. Here, due to unavailability of data for tomato and eggplant, we used SPAM's total
%% vegetable production as surrogate. To disaggregate into monthly production,
%% we studied the relationship between production, precipitation, and elevation.
%% For lowland areas, %(elevation less than ???) 
%% production is negatively
%% correlated with precipitation ($r<-0.75$).

%% \paragraph{Network structure.} The resulting network consists of~$8,010$
%% cells and~$109$ localities.
