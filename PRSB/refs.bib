abstract = {Bangladesh is primarily an agricultural country. Agriculture plays a vital role in its economy in terms of food safety, value addition, export earnings and employment. Bangladesh weather and soils are suitable for a variety of harvests cultivation. More than 100 vegetables are produced in this country. Various types of vegetables are grown in rural Bangladesh in small homesteads and large agricultural land both for the own consumption and commercial purpose. Commercial vegetable trading has an integrated supply chain system which depends on some intermediaries and their activities to take the vegetables from producers to consumers. The main problem is consumer pays two to three times more than the producers' margin. The main objectives of this paper are to investigate the existing vegetable supply chain through value stream analysis and to identify different stakeholders and their activities, and also to illustrate various cost and price movement towards different stages of the supply chain. Based on the questionnaire different data are collected from farmers, different market actors, and consumer and finally problems regarding vegetable value chain are identified. In the existing situation, producers have no control over the vegetable supply chain, product pricing; rather they are strongly influenced by market syndicates. In order to make the problems of the existing supply chain network more understandable different analysis is conducted in this paper. Finally a new network is proposed to the vegetable supply chain.},

abstract = {Currently, the price range of tomatoes is a great loss to the producers or tomato growers in Malaysia. Meanwhile, in terms of the purchasing power of consumers, Malaysia is one of the more prosperous in the countries in Asia with a GDP per capita of about US {\$} 10,876 in 2016. In reducing the width of the tomato price range, it needs of industrial competition analysis or market tomatoes in Cameron Highland pertinent for the issue. The aim of this study was to identify the tomato industry competition in Cameron Highland, Malaysia, and it was conducted in three (3) stages: a) in this stage, carried out literature studies and searches related and related information to the players, organization, customer, and supplier market tomatoes, b) the collection of data and information according to the research objectives, and c) conduct focus group discussions with the topic a tomato industry competition and tabulation of data. Results of the study found that the tomato industry competition is quite significant in Cameron Highland. The threat of substitute product's tomatoes from other regions or import is very dominant. Nearly 60 percent of tomatoes from Thailand supplied to Malaysia. The indicators, tomatoes are very easily available in the entire super market and traditional market in the peninsula Malaysia. Meanwhile, the State Thailand is a threat from new entrants who have high accessibility of land, which is between Bukit Kayu Hitam (Malaysia) and Sadao (Thailand). On the other hand, distributors have greater bargaining power in determining the market price because he is dealing with a large number of intermediaries to be selected. Industry competition structure above causes the position of farmers locked in power distributor or intermediary is dominant. Meanwhile, developments in information technology become an opportunity for farmers to get information about the price of tomatoes at the farmers directly in connection to the supermarket or to the market. Indirectly, the role of intermediaries can be reduced. Thus, the price of tomatoes is not manipulated by them. In addition, farmers can plan for the future market production.},

After invading Spain in 2006, it spread rapidly throughout Afro-Eurasia and has become a major threat to world tomato production. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies have been developed, but widespread insecticide use has caused selection for insecticide resistance as well as undesirable effects on key beneficial arthropods. Augmentation and conservation biological control relying on omnivorous mirid predators has proved successful for management of T. absoluta, where implementation is dependent on abiotic, biotic (e.g., alternative prey), and anthropogenic factors (e.g., pesticides). Research has been carried out on larval parasitoids, showing potential for further development of sustainable control. The development of resistant tomato varieties is ongoing, but they are not commercially available yet. Knowledge gaps remain to be filled to optimize IPM packages on tomato crops and to help prevent further spread worldwide.},

abstract = {An overview is given of the natural, socio-economic, agronomical and marketing conditions for vegetable production in the Red River Delta (RRD) of Vietnam. The seasonal variation in temperature in the RRD is the main determinant for the production season of vegetables. Heavy rainfall in the hot season increases production risks, as it may physically damage crops. Frequent rainfall in this period may enhance disease incidence. Landholdings are small and individual plots are the smallest of Indochina. Vegetables typically are produced in flooded rice based systems. Such systems are characterized by poor soil structure for vegetable production and high labour demand for the construction of raised beds. Highly perishable crops can only be grown close to the markets in the peri-urban areas. Less perishable crops can be produced further away from the city markets. Generally, large quantities of pesticides are used and there is increasing public concern about pesticide residues on products. The small landholdings, small plots and consequently the small amounts of product, limit effective marketing and make the producers dependent on collectors. Given the trends in population dynamics and human diets, urban vegetable demand in the RRD, however, has ample opportunities to grow. Effects have been analysed and categorised in opportunities and constraints for adopting improvements. A potential pathway to sustainable development is the development of permanent vegetable production systems, with producers co-operating in producers organizations, enabling them to work on a larger scale, produce larger volumes, introduce harvest date planning and quality control and aim for the integration of production with marketing in a vegetable value chain. By simultaneously adopting Good Agricultural Practices, consumers' food safety concerns can be addressed. The expected increase in vegetable demand is likely to open new opportunities for the RRD vegetable producers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.

abstract = {The ideal spatial scale, or granularity, at which infectious disease incidence should be monitored and forecast has been little explored. By identifying the optimal granularity for a given disease and host population, and matching surveillance and prediction efforts to this scale, response to emergent and recurrent outbreaks can be improved. Here we explore how granularity and representation of spatial structure affect influenza forecast accuracy within New York City. We develop network models at the borough and neighborhood levels, and use them in conjunction with surveillance data and a data assimilation method to forecast influenza activity. These forecasts are compared to an alternate system that predicts influenza for each borough or neighborhood in isolation. At the borough scale, influenza epidemics are highly synchronous despite substantial differences in intensity, and inclusion of network connectivity among boroughs generally improves forecast accuracy. At the neighborhood scale, we observe much greater spatial heterogeneity among influenza outbreaks including substantial differences in local outbreak timing and structure; however, inclusion of the network model structure generally degrades forecast accuracy. One notable exception is that local outbreak onset, particularly when signal is modest, is better predicted with the network model. These findings suggest that observation and forecast at sub-municipal scales within New York City provides richer, more discriminant information on influenza incidence, particularly at the neighborhood scale where greater heterogeneity exists, and that the spatial spread of influenza among localities can be forecast.},

abstract = {Agent-based models (ABM) are ideal tools to deal with the complexity of pest invasion throughout agricultural socio-ecological systems, yet very few studies have applied them in such context. In this work we developed an ABM that simulates interactions between farmers and an invasive insect pest in an agricultural landscape of the tropical Andes. Our specific aims were to use the model 1) to assess the importance of farmers' mobility and pest control knowledge on pest expansion and 2) to use it as an educational tool to train farmer communities facing pest risks. Our model combined an ecological sub-model, simulating pest population dynamics driven by a cellular automaton including environmental factors of the landscape, with a social model in which we incorporated agents (farmers) potentially transporting and spreading the pest through displacements among villages. Results of model simulation revealed that both agents' movements and knowledge had a significant, non-linear, impact on invasion spread, confirming previous works on disease expansion by epidemiologists. However, heterogeneity in knowledge among agents had a low effect on invasion dynamics except at high levels of knowledge. Evaluations of the training sessions using ABM suggest that farmers would be able to better manage their crop after our implementation. Moreover, by providing farmers with evidence that pests propagated through their community not as the result of isolated decisions but rather as the result of repeated interactions between multiple individuals over time, our ABM allowed introducing them with social and psychological issues which are usually neglected in integrated pest management programs.},

abstract = {Vegetable and fruit production plays an important role on the agriculture of many countries in the world. Vegetable and fruit sector is also an important production sector of Vietnamese agriculture. Vietnam enjoys numerous favorable conditions for vegetable and fruit production in which climate and ground are suitable with tropic, subtropical vegetables and fruits and some temperate vegetables and fruits. Vietnamese vegetable and fruit production in recent years has marked significant progress in both terms of scale and product structure. Various kinds of special vegetables and fruits with high quality have been developed and brought high yield thanks to the sector's application of advanced cultivation techniques, etc. Vietnamese vegetable and fruit sector has gained satisfactory achievements in domestic consumption and export. Plentiful processed products such as tinned and condensed fruits and vegetables have been highly appreciated by domestic and oversea customers. Especially, some new products such as purre, frozen vegetables and fruits have been consumed in America and Japan, etc. In 1995, vegetable and fruit export of Vietnam only was USD 56.1 million, however, by 2007 it reached over USD 300 million, a 6 time increase compared to 1995, made up 0.63{\{}{\%}{\}} in the total export value of Vietnam in 2007. The results and effects which vegetables and fruits bring about are still limited and have not been corresponding with the big potential of the country.},

abstract = {Traditional and modern supply chains for tomato in Cambodia were assessed and possible handling improvements were introduced. Traditional chain involved farmers and collectors in Kandal Province, and wholesalers and retailers in wet markets in the capital of Phnom Penh, about 35 km apart. In the modern chain, only one intermediary between farmers and supermarkets in Phnom Penh was involved; collector-wholesaler in Kandal Province or a development organization in Kampong Speu Province (65 km away from Phnom Penh) which consolidated farmers' produce through its packinghouse facility. Postharvest losses in the traditional and modern chains were about 23{\%} and 22.5{\%}, respectively, but the modern chain had more stringent quality requirements and offered higher prices than the traditional chain. Farmers' losses were mainly due to preharvest damage by insect pests and diseases and immaturity while losses during subsequent handling were due to physical damage, rotting, weight loss and/or over-ripening. Improved packaging, precooling and sanitizing treatments as individual handling improvements were tried in the traditional chain. Use of 20 kg capacity plastic crate with 50 $\mu$m-thick low density polyethylene (LDPE) bagging and 20 kg capacity bamboo basket lined with newsprint reduced fruit damage at the wholesale and retail stages relative to the conventional packaging of using 20 kg capacity 50 $\mu$m-thick high density PE (HDPE). More dramatic effect on weight loss reduction was obtained with both conventional HDPE and plastic crate-LDPE packaging methods. Precooling (5 min dip in 5oC water) and chlorine wash (2 min dip in 200 ppm chlorine solution) combined with LDPE packaging had no pronounced effect on the incidence of fruit damage but reduced weight loss at the retail stage by about two-fold compared to that of fruit conventionally packed in HDPE bag without precooling or chlorine treatment. For the modern chain, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) comparing LDPE and 11 $\mu$m-thick film overwrap was tried under simulated supermarket conditions (15Â°C). Fruit weight loss and ripening were inhibited relative to that at ambient (24-33Â°C, 65-92{\%} RH). MAP had no appreciable effect on weight loss at 15Â°C but further retarded ripening based on colorimetric a* values (red color), soluble solids and citric acid contents. Film overwrap was more effective than LDPE. The results indicate that the handling techniques introducedcould be applied in tomato supply chains to reduce postharvest losses. {\textcopyright} 2008 IFRJ, Faculty of Food Science {\&} Technology, UPM.},

This study provides a market profile and analysis of the purchase and consumption preferences for vegetables of households in Davao City, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos. A systematic sampling method with a random start was used. Three hundred forty eight (348) households were surveyed in proportion to the population of the three cities at the village level. Households generally purchase vegetables three times a week and predominantly from the wet market. While most households consider price as their primary criteria for purchase, quality in use is considered important. Wives continue to play a major role in the decision to purchase, cook and serve vegetables. Usually five (5) kinds of vegetables are purchased per purchase occasion with an average weight of 250 to 600 grams for each kind of vegetable. The commonly purchased vegetables are squash, eggplant, cabbage, okra and string beans (yard beans). Stakeholders in the vegetable supply chain, including smallholder farmers can focus their strategies to develop a strong domestic market for vegetables through increased consumption, and better quality management systems to defend their products against the threat of imports.},

@article{SanSanYi2008,
abstract = {We report the genetic diversity of tomato landraces from Myanmar, with reference to worldwide tomato accessions. Ten simple sequence repeat markers were screened and used to create diversity profiles of tomato germplasm. A total of 133 alleles were amplified from the germplasm investigated; alleles specific to landraces from Myanmar were also observed. Higher genetic diversity for the Myanmar landraces highlighted the broad genetic base of tomato germplasm. Principal component analysis showed that most of the Myanmar landraces were divergent from other accessions. The different approaches used to analyse landrace diversity documented the broader genetic base of germplasm from Myanmar, which is a non-center of origin for tomato. Genetic diversity in the landraces may be attributable to diverse production systems used by different ethnic groups in Myanmar, ranging from natural hydroponics in eastern areas, to slash-and-burn fields in mountain areas and shifting cultivation in many parts of the country. The availability of uniform and high-yielding cultivars/hybrids threatens the valuable landraces in Myanmar. We emphasize the need to evaluate tomato germplasm from Myanmar for different traits and sustainable use with simultaneous conservation.},

@article{venette2010,
abstract = {Pest risk maps are powerful visual communication tools to describe where invasive alien species might arrive, establish, spread, or cause harmful impacts. These maps inform strategic and tactical pest management decisions, such as potential restrictions on international trade or the design of pest surveys and domestic quarantines. Diverse methods are available to create pest risk maps, and can potentially yield different depictions of risk for the same species. Inherent uncertainties about the biology of the invader, future climate conditions, and species interactions further complicate map interpretation. If multiple maps are available, risk managers must choose how to incorporate the various representations of risk into their decisionmaking process, and may make significant errors if they misunderstand what each map portrays. This article describes the need for pest risk maps, compares pest risk mapping methods, and recommends future research to improve such important decision-support tools.},
