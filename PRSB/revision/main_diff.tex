\begin{abstract}
Modern food systems facilitate rapid dispersal of pests and pathogens
through multiple pathways. The complexity of spread dynamics and data
inadequacy make it challenging to model the phenomenon and also to prepare
for emerging invasions. We present a generic framework to study the
spatiotemporal spread of invasive species as a multi-scale propagation
process over a time-varying network accounting for climate, biology,
seasonal production, trade, and demographic information. Machine learning
techniques are used in a novel manner to capture model variability and
analyse parameter sensitivity. We applied the framework to understand the
spread of a devastating pest of tomato, \emph{Tuta absoluta}, in South and
Southeast Asia, a region at the frontier of its current range. Analysis
with respect to historical invasion records suggests that even with modest
self-mediated spread capabilities, the pest can quickly expand its range
through domestic city-to-city vegetable trade. Our models forecast that
within five to seven years, \tuta{} will invade all major vegetable growing
areas of Mainland Southeast Asia assuming unmitigated spread. Monitoring
high consumption areas can help in early detection, and targeted
interventions at major production areas can effectively reduce the rate of
spread.

\section{Introduction}
As the intensity of trade and human mobility increase, so does the rate of
exotic species invasions~\cite{hulme2009trade}. Climate change and the
detrimental impact of intensive agriculture on natural resources further
aggravate this problem~\cite{early2016global}.  Understanding the dynamics
of invasive species spread is imperative for achieving zero hunger, no
poverty, good health and well being, which are among the sustainable
development goals drafted by the United
Nations~\cite{un_sustainable_development}. Models play an important role in
predicting the spatiotemporal spread, identifying roles of different
pathways, assessing efficacy of control strategies, and exposing gaps in
the understanding of the
phenomenon~\cite{cunniffe2015thirteen,epstein2008model}. However, impending
invasions of agricultural pests present difficult challenges.  Accounting
for multiple drivers of dispersal invariably makes the model complex.  At
the same time, data inadequacy makes it nearly impossible to calibrate and
validate these models. Despite these limitations, a natural goal for a
modeller is to provide useful insights into the mechanisms of spread, and
thus help design effective policies for its prevention and mitigation.

Network propagation models have been widely used to study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{large interacting
biological, social and technical systems. Some examples include infectious disease }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{phenomena as
diverse as infectious disease and invasive species }\DIFaddend spread, online social
networks, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend cascading failures in infrastructure
networks~\cite{barrat2008dynamical}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Increasingly,

survey the invasive species literature categorising various efforts into
flow-based pathway models and agent-based models. Network representations
and analysis are being increasingly applied to capture human-mediated
pathways of spread~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

and
mitigation~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend . Unlike pest risk maps generated by
species distribution models~\cite{pearson2007species}, the resulting
dynamics of such a validated model yields a causal description of the
underlying complex system.

\DIFdel{We applied this framework }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We applied it }\DIFaddend to study the spread of the South
American tomato leafminer or \emph{Tuta absoluta}, a pest of the tomato
crop and representative of recent biological invasions that have
significantly perturbed global food production. Indigenous to South
America, \tuta{} was accidentally introduced to Spain in~2006, and since
then has rapidly spread throughout Europe, Africa, Western and Central
Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of Central
America~\cite{desneux2010biological,biondi2017}. %DIF < % With tomato being a
%DIF < % commercially important crop, this invasion has had significant global
%DIF < % impact~\cite{campos2017western}. 
It is well accepted that
trade played a critical role in \tuta{}'s rapid spread. On multiple
occasions it has been discovered in packaging stations and its spread
pattern is correlated with prime trade routes~\cite{karadjova2013tuta}. Our
study region is South and Southeast Asia-- a region at the frontier of its
current range -- comprising of 10 countries: members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Bangladesh. In recent years, there has
been a thrust to improve vegetable production in all the countries of this
region. With the pest having already spread to major tomato producing areas
in Bangladesh, there is a high chance that it will be introduced to the
remaining countries in the near future. Such invasions can have devastating
effect on the economy and livelihood of farmers. Moreover, the invasion in
Mainland Southeast Asia in particular is a serious threat to China, the
largest producer of tomato, and Australasian neighbours. To our knowledge,
this is the first study that explicitly considers multiple pathways of
introduction and spread of \tuta{}. Earlier modelling efforts have only
accounted for ecological aspects and self-mediated
spread~\cite{desneux2010biological,tonnang2015identification,guimapi2016modeling}.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A precursor to this work~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

Our \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contributions are multifold. We provide a generic data-driven approach

and analyse the multi-pathway model with respect to ground truth by a novel

%%
\section{Methods}
%%
\paragraph{Data.} The global datasets used in the model and for analysis
are described in Table~\ref{S:tab:data} of the supplement. Country specific
data on seasonal production, consumption, processing, and trade was obtained
from websites of agriculture ministries, research articles and technical
reports (Table~\ref{S:tab:countryData} in the supplement). Almost all the
datasets used are openly available. The details of \tuta{} biology can be
found in the supplement. 
%% Some information was provided by 
%% contacts in Bangladesh (for e.g., \tuta{} incidence reports in
%% Table~\ref{S:tab:bgdData}), Vietnam, and Cambodia.
%%
\paragraph{Multi-pathway spread model.} We developed a stochastic
multi-scale propagation model to simulate the multi-pathway spread
of~\tuta{}. Key concepts are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:concept}. The
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{model parameters and their values are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:param}.
A discussion on the choice of model structure and assumptions is presented
in Section~\ref{S:sec:modelAssumptions} of the supplement. The }\DIFaddend study region
is divided into cells -- the smallest spatial units -- by overlaying a grid
(0.25\textdegree~$\times$~0.25\textdegree). Each cell is in one of the
three states: susceptible ($S$) denoting pest free state, exposed ($E$)
denoting that the pest has been introduced but the population has not yet
built up to influence other cells, and infectious ($I$) denoting that the
pest has established and the cell can influence its neighbours. The cell
states are updated in discrete time steps, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where the
interval between successive time steps corresponds to a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{each corresponding to one }\DIFaddend month.
The probability that a cell~$v$ transitions from state~$S$ to~$E$ is
determined by (i)~suitability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the cell for \tuta{} }\DIFdelend to establish at that time
step~$\suitable(v,t)$ and (ii)~influence of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``neighbouring'' cells }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{neighbours }\DIFaddend in state~$I$
depending on the pathway. An exposed cell transitions to state~$I$ after a
latency period of~$\ell$ time steps. This is the time required for the
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{excess }\DIFaddend population to build up to infect other cells. Once the pest has
established in a cell, the cell remains infected forever, a fair assumption
considering that, historically, eradication of \tuta{} has not been
successful (the only exception being United Kingdom). The infectiousness of
a cell~$\infest(v,t)$ is modelled as a linear function of host \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{presence }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{density }\DIFaddend at
time~$t$, for which we use the weighted sum of production volume of tomato,
eggplant, and potato in that cell at time~$t$. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{weights correspond to relative carrying capacity of \tuta{} on the
three
hosts~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

%%

There are three pathways by which a cell can become infected:
short-distance dispersal, local human-mediated dispersal and long-distance
dispersal. Short-distance dispersal captures the spread through natural
means; from an infested cell to cells in its Moore neighbourhood of
range~$\mooreRange$.  The probability that a susceptible cell gets exposed
(E) at time step~$t$ through short-distance spread is as follows:
%%
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:pshort}
    \pshort(v,t)=\suitable(v,t)\bigg(1-
    \exp\Big(-\asd\sum_{v'\in\moore_v(\mooreRange)}\infest(v',t)\Big)\bigg)\,.
\end{align}
\end{linenomath}
%%
The probability depends on the suitability of the cell~$\suitable(v,t)$,
infestation level of each neighbouring cell in the Moore neighbourhood with
range~$\mooreRange$,~$\infest(v',t)$, and the scaling factor,~$\asd$, which
is the transmission rate for this pathway. The function form is explained
in Section~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{S:trans}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{S:sec:modelAssumptions}}\DIFaddend .

For human-assisted spread we identified large urban areas in the region
which we refer to as {\it localities} (Figure~\ref{fig:concept}) and
considered interactions within and between localities. These areas have
significant trade flows due to high consumption or production. Each
\emph{locality} consists of all grid cells which are within a certain
distance (determined by \emph{locality radius}) from its corresponding
centre. Local human-mediated dispersal is modelled as the spread between
cells belonging to a locality.  Every cell~$v$ is influenced by cells in
its locality~$\locality$ based on their infectiousness.  The expression is
similar to that in equation~\eqref{eqn:pshort}, but with cells in the locality
instead of the Moore neighbourhood

Long-distance human-mediated dispersal corresponds to spread through trade
between localities. For this purpose, we considered only tomato trade as
there is not much evidence of \tuta{} spreading through trade of other
hosts. We modelled domestic trade using a gravity model approach accounting
for tomato production, processing, imports, and exports in each locality,
and the travel time between localities.  The probability of spread is
directly proportional to the trade flow~$F_{ij}$ from one locality ($i$) to
another ($j$).  Suppose cell~$v$ belongs to locality~$i$. Then, the
probability of cell~$v$ transitioning from~$S$ to~$E$ due to long-distance
human-mediated dispersal is given by:

\paragraph{Network construction.} 
Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline} provides a schematic of the network construction.
The first step was to estimate monthly production volume of tomato,
eggplant, and potato for each cell. We estimated annual production in each
cell followed by disaggregation to monthly production. The annual
production was estimated using the vegetable production available at the
highest resolution for each country (at the level of province to just one
value for the entire country) and a synthetic dataset called Spatial
Production Allocation Model~\cite{spam}. For monthly production, we
used linear regression to model the production rate as a function of
precipitation, temperature, and elevation. Seasonal tomato and eggplant
production data for different regions of Philippines was used. For most of
the other countries only qualitative information on seasonal production
is available (Table~\ref{S:tab:countryData}). The regression function was
applied to locations of these countries where this information is
available and visually compared available data. The details are in
Section~\ref{S:sec:prod} of the supplement.

To model locality-to-locality trade, we applied the approach of
Venkatramanan~et~al.~\cite{venkatramanan2019modeling}
with some modifications. We modelled the flow of fresh tomato crop between
markets based on the following assumptions: (i)~the total outflow from a
city depends on the amount of produce in its surrounding regions and
imports from countries outside the focus region at time~$t$, and (ii)~the
total inflow depends on total consumption, processing demand, and exports
from the city to countries outside the focus region. The details are in
Section~\ref{S:sec:netcon}.  Trade between countries of the focus region
was not modelled as there is no adequate information on ports of entry or
monthly flow volumes. But, it was accounted for while analyzing the
possible routes of introduction.

\paragraph{Parameterization and experiment design.}
The goodness of fit of a parameter instance was determined by comparing the
simulation output with \tuta{} incidence reports
(Figure~\ref{fig:bgdClassA} and Table~\ref{S:tab:bgdData} for Bangladesh).
The spread was simulated with infestation starting from the location of
first report. For each cell\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, empirical probability }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~$v$ and model configuration~$C$, the empirical
probability~$p(C,v,t)$ }\DIFaddend that it is in state~$I$ at time~$t$ was computed
(averaged over 100 repetitions). The output was compared to ground truth
using a similarity
function adapted from~\cite{carrasco2010unveiling}.  Let~$v$ be a reporting
cell and~$t_v$ denote the month of the actual report of pest presence.  To
account for uncertainty in reporting, we consider a time
window~$U_\tau=[t_v-\tau,t_v+\tau]$ during comparison, where~$\tau$ is the
uncertainty parameter. We set~$\tau=2$, that is, error within $\pm2$ months is
tolerated.  Supposing~$\reportingCells$ is the set of cells corresponding
to ground truth, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and ~$p(C,v,t)$ is the empirical probability that
cell~$v$ is infected at time~$t$ for the input configuration~$C$, }\DIFdelend then the
similarity~$\similarity$ is given by
%%
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:similarity}
    \similarity(C)=\frac{1}{|\reportingCells|}\sum_{v\in\reportingCells} \Big(\sum_{t\in U_\tau}p(C,v,t)
    + \sum_{t\notin U_\tau}\big(1-p(C,v,t)\big) \Big)\,.
\end{align}
\end{linenomath}
%%
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Note that $\similarity(C)$ attains a maximum value of one when the
simulation output is a perfect match (within the error tolerance limit).
}\DIFdelend %DIF > % Note that $\similarity(C)$ attains a maximum value of one when the

For parameter space exploration, we were motivated by a recent approach of
using machine learning surrogates~\cite{lamperti2018agent}. In our
iterative ``go with the winners'' process~\cite{aldous1994go} the subspace
under consideration is sampled uniformly \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(the first part of
Figure~\ref{fig:clusterOutline})}\DIFaddend . Then, with model parameters as features
and the similarity score as the dependent variable, we use Classification
and Regression Trees (CART) approach to identify parts of the subspace for
which the similarity score is high and reject the remaining. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In the
following iteration, these subspaces are sampled uniformly, and the process
continues. The approach is very similar to the }\emph{\DIFadd{reverse engineering
approach}} \DIFadd{used to build an interpretable learner for a black box
model~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite[Fig. 10]{guidotti2019survey}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. In the interpretable machine
learning framework, the black box is a machine learning algorithm like a
neural network or tree ensemble, while in our case, the black box is an
agent-based model. }\DIFaddend Simulations were performed for more than~$500,000$
parameter combinations using a high performance computing cluster.
Configurations with similarity score $\similarity(C)\ge0.75$ were chosen
for further analysis.


%% Parameter space exploration was conducted in multiple iterations (the
%% ranges or values of model parameters are in Table~\ref{tab:param}). First,
%% we coarsely sampled the space. Then, with model parameters as independent
%% variables and the goodness of fit measure defined in~\eqref{eqn:similarity}
%% as the dependent variable, we used a Classification and Regression Trees
%% (CART) approach to identify subspaces for which the similarity score was
%% high and rejected subspaces for which it was low. Based on this, in the
%% subsequent phases, we refined our search to improve the parameterization.

\paragraph{Analysis of spread pattern.} The objective here is to analyse
the variability in the simulation outcomes within the set of best fit
configurations. We leverage well-known machine learning techniques in a
novel way to address this question. The methodology is outlined in
Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{S:fig:clusterOutline} in the supplement}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:clusterOutline}}\DIFaddend . First, we cluster the simulation outputs
(time and cell indexed empirical probabilities) of selected configurations
from the parameterization phase. This step captures the variability in
outcomes; simulation outputs belonging to different clusters can be
considered to be significantly different from one another.  In the second
step, we attempt to infer relationships between model parameters and
cluster membership. To this end, our approach is to cast this as a
classification problem using CART with model parameters as the features and
cluster index as the label. The relationships are inferred from the
decision tree that resulted from the algorithm.  To avoid any bias
introduced by the clustering algorithm, we also apply more than one method
-- hierarchical agglomerative clustering and the $k$-means algorithm. In
both cases, we use the Euclidean distance as the distance measure to
compare two simulation outputs. The analysis is repeated for different
values of~$k$, the number of clusters.  More details are provided in
Section~\ref{S:sec:cluster} of the supplement. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{To assess the relative importance of model parameters, we adopted the
approach of~ Lamperti~et~al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\section{Results}
\paragraph{Variability in spread pattern.} The clustering analysis of the
configurations selected during the parameterization phase (approximately
8000 of them) reveals two distinct spread patterns primarily determined by
the pathway parameters.  The first class of models
(Figure~\ref{fig:bgdClassA}), referred to as Class~A, is characterised by
the absence of long-distance human-mediated spread ($\ald$ negligible) and
brisk spread between geographically adjacent cells, driven by the latency
period~$\ell$, the Moore range~$\mooreRange$, and the short-distance scaling
factor~$\asd$. In contrast, for Class~B models
(Figure~\ref{fig:bgdClassB1}), the long-distance pathway~($\ald$) plays a
significant role  and there is relatively slow spread between
geographically adjacent neighbours. Both hierarchical clustering and
$k$-means clustering (Figures~\ref{S:fig:cartAgglomerative}(b)
and~\ref{S:fig:cartkmeans}(a)) are consistent in this regard.

%%

The Class~A spread pattern does not capture the gap between the time of first
report (Panchagarh) and the report in Gaibandha district
(Figure~\ref{fig:bgdClassA}). Even though the distance between the two
locations is only $185$km, the latter reported the presence only after~10
months of first report, suggesting that self-mediated spread might have been
much slower. In the model output on the other hand, the corresponding cell
gets infected between the second and fourth months.  In Class~B, this
location is infected much later in comparison. However, the eastward spread
towards the location Jaintiapur is slower than what was observed
(Figure~\ref{fig:bgdClassB1}). Even though Panchagarh is quite far from
this location, pest presence was reported by February 2017, just nine
months after the first report.  As a baseline, we also simulated the spread
using the cellular automata model developed by
Guimapi~\cite{guimapi2016modeling} for Bangladesh. The spread pattern is
similar to Class~A as the model does not account for long-distance hops.
However, the predicted rate of range expansion is much higher than our
models (see Section~\ref{S:sec:guimapi} for model details and results).

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The relative importance of model parameters was assessed using random
forest algorithm with regard to their influence on (i)~similarity score
($\similarity$) and (ii)~spread pattern, which in our
case, is akin to cluster membership. }\DIFdelend In the case of spread pattern, the
importance was derived for each~$k$ (number of clusters) and clustering
algorithm. Some results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:rf}. We note that
the long-distance scaling factor ($\ald$) is among the top three important
parameters. The start month ($t_s$) is also important for two reasons.
Firstly, the distance between two time shifted simulation outputs can be
large. Secondly, outputs are sensitive to seasonal variations or
temporality of the network.  Latency period ($\ell$) and Moore range
($\mooreRange$) together control the extent of radial spread in a time
step. Typically for Class~A models, $\mooreRange$ is high and $\ell$ is
low and the other way round in the case of Class~B models. Analysis of
trade flows and seasonality is presented in
Section~\ref{S:sec:locality_flows}
in the supplement.

\paragraph{Scenarios of pest introduction to countries in Southeast Asia.}
To identify routes of introduction to other countries in the region, we
applied both Class~A and Class~B models. The starting point of the spread
corresponds to the Panchagarh district (Figure~\ref{fig:bgdClassA}). Both model
classes strongly indicate that \tuta{} is already present in parts of
Myanmar (curves corresponding to time step 24, or two years from first
report). Also, the pest is likely to enter Thailand from Myanmar, and
subsequently move to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam as it spreads eastwards, and
to China when it spreads northwards. From Thailand, spreading southward, it
will enter Malaysia and subsequently enter Indonesia
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure~\ref{S:fig:msaClassAB}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figures~\ref{fig:msaClassA} and~\ref{fig:msaClassB}}\DIFaddend ).


We also analysed the international tomato trade network
(Section~\ref{S:sec:tomnet} of supplement) to assess the risk due to
imports from \tuta{} infested countries outside this region.  Malaysia and
Singapore are important hubs with tomato imports from \tuta{} infested
regions. There is a possibility that \tuta{} is directly introduced to
these regions.  However, in both cases, the import volume is very low.
Also, the introduction risk depends on the preventive measures taken by the
exporting countries. With respect to both trade and natural pathways, there
is a low chance that the pest will be introduced into Philippines from
neighbouring countries, as there are no shared borders with any country in
the region nor evidence of tomato trade. However, human mobility is a
possible pathway. For example, the Middle East is the top destination for
Filipino workers.%%~\cite{rodriguez2011philippine}.
%%
\paragraph{Predicted spread is model and region dependent.} In the case of
Class~A models, the eastward spread is faster than southward spread
(Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{S:fig:msaClassA} in the supplement}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:msaClassA}}\DIFaddend ). This is mainly because the Moore
neighbourhood is smaller at the narrow region in the south of Myanmar and
Thailand bordering Malaysia.  However, in the case of Class~B
(Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{S:fig:msaClassB}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:msaClassB}}\DIFaddend ), the spread is much faster in the same region
aided by domestic trade flows from northern and central Thailand to the
southern region. The Class~A spread pattern predicts that within the next
4-5 years, much of the northern part of Mainland Southeast Asia will be
invaded.  The Class~B spread pattern predicts that in the same period,
\tuta{} will spread all over Malaysia and Singapore.  However, the rate of
spread observed is slower than that observed in Bangladesh for both
classes. Also, even though the models exhibited a similar rate of spread
for Bangladesh, we observed high variance in intensity of infestation as
well as range expansion for the rest of the region. The results are in
Figure~\ref{S:fig:spreadRate} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the supplement}\DIFaddend . The reason for slow spread
is as follows.  Bangladesh has the highest tomato volume per country
surface area ($\approx2.5$tonnes/km$^2$).  The next country is Vietnam
($\approx1.5$tonnes/km$^2$). Therefore, in the case of Bangladesh, not only
is the extent of infestation in a cell~$\infest(\cdot)$ typically high, but
also since it is a densely populated country, most cells have vegetable
production. Hence, the rate of spread is much higher for relatively lower
values of pathway parameters and Moore range. Also, we observed a strong
dependence on Moore range (Figure~\ref{S:fig:spreadRateB}).  In
geographically larger countries, the production is scattered. Therefore,
the lower the Moore range, the slower the spread.

\paragraph{Influence of domestic trade on spread pattern and rate.}
Here, we focus on long-distance dispersal and therefore restrict our
discussion to Class~B models. For the country-specific studies, the
starting location was decided based on our analysis of possible entry
points through different pathways (Section~\ref{S:sec:seeds} in the
supplement).  We observed the following common spread pattern.  When the
invasive species is introduced to a country, dispersal is slow until the
invasion front reaches a {production source}. Once it establishes at a
source, the spread is very fast.  Depending on the country, within~12 to~24
time steps (or 1-2 years), it spreads to almost all major localities of
the country (see Figure~\ref{fig:thlBContourInt} for example). Production
areas which are very close to high-consumption localities (large urban
areas) are particularly vulnerable. Since local production typically does
not satisfy demands of such localities, they have high inflows from other
production areas and possibly from other countries. As a result, these
localities are quickly infected. Once introduced to such localities,
farmer--market interactions (local human-mediated dispersal) can facilitate
the introduction of the pest to nearby production regions where it can
establish and proliferate. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Similar observations have been made in a number
of works~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{kiss2006network,pautasso2010disease}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend 

%%
Given that monitoring and quarantining are both resource intensive and
potentially disruptive, developing strategies that involve few locations
yet provide near-optimal control is a goal for modellers.  Market-level
phytosanitary measures in terms of import restrictions have been undertaken
by countries~\cite{USDA2012}. Here, we evaluated a simple strategy for
containing the spread through the trade pathway. Localities associated with
high annual outflows were identified (at most four in each country). As
discussed earlier, pest establishment in these areas can potentially lead
to rapid range expansion. The outflow from the targeted localities was cut
off to mimic control at the trade/market level. In the strictest sense,
this can be implemented by restricting trade of host crops. But, it is
possible that phytosanitary measures have the same effect.
Figure~\ref{fig:spread} shows results for two countries.  More results are
present in Figure~\ref{S:fig:intervene} in the supplement.  Consistently,
across countries, we observed a significant reduction in range expansion as
well as intensity of spread.  Besides, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:thlBContourInt}, stifling these flows localises the spread
that resembles those of Class~A models, but with much less intensity.

\section{Discussion}
The variability in the spread patterns that explain the incidence reports
exposes the lack of understanding of the pathways of spread.  Nevertheless,
the analysis does strongly indicate the role of human-assisted spread of
\tuta{}. The pest was reported in May~2016 in the northwestern part of
Bangladesh bordering India. The region is among the top three tomato
producers in the country. By the beginning of the next production season,
\tuta{} was found in almost every major urban region.  Similar correlation
between tomato trade and \tuta{} spread was observed in
Nepal~\cite{venkatramanan2019modeling}. Studies on self-mediated spread
(flying capability or by wind) can definitely help estimate more accurately
the rate of self-mediated spread. It is also important to consider
alternate scenarios of introduction. We recall that the far eastern part of
Bangladesh (locality Jaintiapur in Figure~\ref{fig:bgdClassB1}) reported
pest presence nine months after the first report. This place happens to be
close to an important trade route connecting Northeastern Bangladesh to
Meghalaya in India, where \tuta{} was officially reported in January 2017.
Therefore, it is possible that multiple incursions took place.

Historically, international trade has played a strong role in the spread of
\tuta{} between countries. For example, the pest was first reported by
India in~2014. By early~2016, it was discovered in the Kathmandu area of
Nepal and in the northern part of Bangladesh in May~2016. Both countries import
significant volumes of tomatoes from India. However, there has been no report
from Pakistan, another neighbour which does not import tomato from India.
There are similar examples outside the region such as its slow advance from
South America to Central America, or the fact that it is not reported in
China despite being present in neighbouring Central Asian countries
since~2015.  We recall the discussion on slow predicted rate of spread in
Mainland Southeast Asia compared to the observed rate in Bangladesh. One
reason for this could be the unaccounted trade flows between countries.
International trade within this region is not documented well.  It is
critical to address the data gaps concerning international trade,
particularly considering that production and trade between countries in
this region have been increasing over the years (details are in
Section~\ref{S:sec:tomnet} of supplement).

While several integrated pest management strategies have been suggested for
managing \tuta{}, hardly any work has been done in designing effective
interventions at the trade level. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Designing phytosanitary measures targeted
towards markets and vehicles of transportation for preventing introductions
(or reintroductions) is therefore a promising research direction. }\DIFdelend Some countries have already taken
measures in this regard. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our results also

Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture (USDA-APHIS) has
instituted quarantine regulations for imports from regions where the pest

network to reduce infectious disease spread is a widely studied topic.

\paragraph{Challenges and limitations.} Modelling emerging invasions is
particularly challenging. Limited data on incidence and understanding of
the underlying dynamics makes it nearly impossible to calibrate and
validate the models.   We have had to simplify or ignore some of the
processes that might significantly influence the spread.  For example, our
model uses monthly production as a surrogate for infectiousness of a cell.
Complex phenology models can be used instead (as in
Carrasco~et~al.~\cite{carrasco2010unveiling}), but would add to the
complexity of the model.
Since our focus region spans multiple countries, identifying and collecting
data for each country was a lengthy process. For many countries, data had
to be collected (or even inferred) from several publications and reports
(Table~\ref{S:tab:countryData}). Further, these datasets were misaligned in
time and spatial resolution.  It is important to account for heterogeneity
in production, consumption, awareness, cultural factors, etc. both within
and between countries.  Some countries are technologically more advanced
than others, which manifests as differences in yield, crop loss, trade
infrastructure, pest awareness, and preparation for
invasion~\cite{early2016global}.

In particular, it is hard to model human-assisted spread owing to lack of
seasonal trade data. To determine outflows and inflows for each locality,
we had to identify major ports for import(s) and export(s) as well as
estimate the fraction of production which was used for processing and was
available only for a few countries. The farm--market-consumer interactions
(local human-mediated spread) involves various actors such as farmers,
wholesalers, retailers, wet markets, supermarkets, and so on. Modelling
this is a challenge in itself. If data on actual flows of vegetables is
provided, the gravity model can be improved or replaced by more
sophisticated approaches. Also, the relationship between long-distance
invasion risk and trade volume is hard to determine. While a direct
relationship between volume and risk is plausible, whether the relation is
linear (as assumed by our model) is unclear.

\paragraph{Conclusion.} Traditionally, in developing countries, crops such
as tomato are seasonal. However, over the past decade, due to rising demand and
opportunities to export, there has been a thrust towards year-round
production using protected cultivation methods and resilient varieties.
An increase in urban population, short shelf life of vegetables, and the
advantages of short marketing chains have encouraged urban agriculture in
developing countries~\cite{moustier2015urban}. Our results indicate that
such urban and peri-urban agriculture is particularly vulnerable to
invasive species attacks. In particular, in Southeast Asia, vegetable
production and internal trade have steadily increased. In comparison, the
export of tomato outside of the focus region has risen steeply in 
recent years (after 2011), while the imports generally indicate a downward
trend.  Therefore, invasions from pests such as \tuta{} can have a huge
negative impact on the socioeconomic fabric of this region. The modelling
and analysis framework presented here is generic and applicable to other
invasive species.  The methodology is modular and leverages popular
learning algorithms to analyse complex models under data scarcity.  Other
potential applications for this work include studies of natural or
human-initiated disasters, climate change, and optimisation of food flows.
