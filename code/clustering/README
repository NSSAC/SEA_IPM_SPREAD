The files with prefix "master_" contain the usage of the code. For most
python scripts, "<script> -h" provides a brief description of what the code
does, its input and output.

master_cluster.sh: Preprocessing simulation output, clustering it and post
processing the outcomes.

master_analysis.sh: CART and Random Forest analysis of the clustered data.

cart_cluster.R: CART analysis of clustered data.

random_forest_cluster.R: Random Forest analysis of clustered data.

cluster_instances.py: Clusters simulation output using pyclustering.

post_process_simfile.py: Simulation files are processed and concatenated
into a single csv file given as input to cluster_instances.py
