The following are major steps:
1. Extract relevant files from the simulation output folder.
2. Obtain ordering of cells for each file.
3. Cluster them.

Folder structure:
*****************
All scripts are in ./scripts folder. They are always executed in ./work
folder. The results are stored in ./results. Intermediate files will be in
./obj.

Summary:
********
Currently, the entire pipeline is captured by scripts/rank_cluster.sh
Step 1 is accomplished using bash scripts; 2 by python; and 3 by R.

Step 1: Extract files
*********************
This was accomplished using extract_files() function in RANK_CLUSTER. The
files were extracted from ../cellular_automata/sim_out_files and copied to
./work/results_BGD_6. "6" denotes all instances with similarity score >*6.
Details are in extract_files(). Later, this folder needs to be moved to obj
or elsewhere I guess. zip and commit it to repo if required.
